--##########################################

===============
Changes Ingame:
===============

-- Changed Redcore Dust Blender Recipe
-- Changed "Packaged Hydrogen Gas" to Hydrogen Gas and added description.
-- Change Silica Dust to Quartz Crystal Silica Dust
-- Changed Reactor Diamond Battery to when used have no waste out of the reactor. [TESTING]
-- Changed NitricOxcide Gas Icon
-- Changed Oxygen Gas Icon
-- Changed Dark Iron to Steel
-- Added EXHZ Ingots Cat
-- Change Dust to Iron ingots from 15 to 10
-- Changed Models for drone and reactor nuclear batterys till I make better ones. (Icons Still Show old models)
-- Changed Diamond Nuclear Battery Core (Was Diamond Nuclear Battery Casing) Change was made due to two items
   are able to be produced from this. 
-- Diamond only shows once its Milestone (Diamonds Are Forever) has been completed.



=================
Changes Internal:
=================
-- Changed Dusts to be made in Smelter under Grinder Cat to be a machine of its own implemented in a futrue update.
-- Created Smasher Cat to be a machine in a future update and moved Diamond Recipe to be in this via the Constructor.
-- Moved internal file structure around (Might break some Recipes, Coupon and Power Shard was moved.)
-- Moved Internal File Structure around (Might break some Recipes) Should not effect anything though as links were not broken in testing.
-- Changed Hydrogen Gas to Exmor Horizon : Blender Cat
-- Changed Redcore Liquid to Exmor Horizon : Blender Cat
-- Changed Oxygen Gas to Exmor Horizon : Blender Cat
-- Moved Internal File Structure around EXHZ Blender and EXHZ Combiner (Might break some Recipes) Should not effect anything though as links were not broken in testing.

-- Changed Recipe for Nickel (Iron + Copper + Caterium + Aluminium)
-- Changed Recipe for Tin (Iron + Aluminium)
-- Changed Recipe for Silver (Caterium + Aluminium)
-- Changed Recipe for Platinium (Iron + Aluminium + Caterium)
-- Changed Recipe for Magnesium (Copper + Caterium)


====
TODO
====
-- Make Alternate Recipe for all dusts using Refinery for all Dusts to Ingots
-- Add Sodium-Sulphur Battery [Might]
-- Add Salt Extraction to Oxygen Recipe. [Might] 
-- Add Ingots 100 per miniute from blender using Hydrogen and Ore [100 in 100 Out]

H2 firing has a higher stoichiometric adiabatic flame temperature of 2,182°C, while natural gas has an
adiabatic flame temperature of 1,937°C (these measurements are cited from “Combustion – Second Edition” by
